# Battery Saftey
-The husky lead acid battery is considered to have 7% left when its at 22volts.
-As a general rule, charge it at 22 volts. You risk damaging the battery if it goes below 19V.
-18V is considered completely dead (down to 0.5% capacity). But its hard to charge a lead acid battery if it goes that far. It might not charge up to the same capacity.
